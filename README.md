This is a basic Raytracer that generates PPM pictures.
It was created following the Raytracer in a weekend guide from here: https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html
You'll have to download a PPM image reader if you're on Windows, since there is no in-built image viewer, that can read PPM format images.

In order to build the project, create a build directory in the root, cd in said build directory and run:
- cmake ../
- cmake --build .
